Test Cases E and F:

E) Malloc an increasing number of bytes starting with 1 and
ending at 50. Increase by 1 byte every iteration. Free memory
when no longer available and at the end.
This tests for different sizes of malloc()s and also free()s.

F) Randomly choose between a large randomly sized malloc
or free. Size between 100 and 1000 bytes. Do this 200
times and free when no memory available and at end.
This tests for large malloc()s and free()s where there
is often no memory avilable.
